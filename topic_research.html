	<h3>What is Fast Fashion?</h3>
	<p>Definition: "Fast fashion is a design, manufacturing, and marketing method focused on rapidly producing high volumes of clothing. Fast fashion garment production leverages trend replication and low-quality materials (like synthetic fabrics) in order to bring inexpensive styles to the end consumer." <a href= "https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/what-is-fast-fashion/#:~:text=Fast%20fashion%20is%20a%20design,styles%20to%20the%20end%20consumer.">(The Good Trade)</a> </p>
	<h3>Why is Fast Fashion Bad?</h3>
	<p>- Fabrics are made from fossil fuels, one of the laragest ecosystem polluter. <a href="https://www.eco-stylist.com/why-is-fast-fashion-bad/#:~:text=These%20fabrics%20are%20plastics%20made,fast%20fashion%20items%20we%20wear.">(Eco-Stylist)</a></p>
	<p>- Products made in bulk to achieve lower costs. <a href="https://www.eco-stylist.com/why-is-fast-fashion-bad/#:~:text=These%20fabrics%20are%20plastics%20made,fast%20fashion%20items%20we%20wear.">(Eco-Stylist)</a></p>
	<p>- "With clothing being so cheap, consumers are able to buy more. An entire industry surrounding seasonal trends has grown up, replacing a previous focus on quality and durability. Today, the average American purchases about 70 pieces of clothing each year, but spends less than 3.5% of its budget on clothes. Now only about 2% of clothes sold in the U.S. are made in the U.S. With such hunger from consumers for new items, fashion companies have moved from releasing clothes seasonally (four times a year) to a model of frequent releases, sometimes refreshing their stock on a weekly basis." <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/fast-fashion-environmental-ethical-issues-4869800">(Treehugger)</a></p>
	<p>- Cheap, trendy clothes are thrown away more and that leads to textile waste (17 million tons in 2018, 2.5 million were recycled). Pieces are hard to separate for proper recycling to be achieved. <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/fast-fashion-environmental-ethical-issues-4869800">(Treehugger)</a></p>
	<p>- "The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global CO2 emissions each year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation." This comes from transportation from factories to outlets.  <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/fast-fashion-environmental-ethical-issues-4869800">(Treehugger)</a></p>
	<p>- Synthetic fabrics contain microplastics are tiny shreds make their way into the water which marine animals then digest. In addition, many dyes and chemicals for colors are toxic. <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/fast-fashion-environmental-ethical-issues-4869800">(Treehugger)</a></p>
	<p>- Factories where clothes are made are essentially sweatshops. Workers work long hours and receive low wages. Children are employed. These work environments lead to workers being exposed to chemicals and risk their safety. <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/fast-fashion-environmental-ethical-issues-4869800">(Treehugger)</a></p>
	<h3>When Did Fast Fashion Become Popular?</h3>
	<p>- "If you've ever wondered when fashion trends began moving at a dizzying speed, it was the 1960s, as young people embraced cheaply made clothing to follow these new trends and reject the sartorial traditions of older generations." <a href="https://fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion">(Fashionista)</a></p>
	<p>- "Although it is difficult to pinpoint the origins of fast fashion as we know it today, it's easy to understand how the phenomenon caught on. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it became increasingly more acceptable (and desirable) to flaunt one's love for low-cost fashion, and seen as especially savvy to be able to mix high and low fashion with aplomb." <a href="https://fashionista.com/2016/06/what-is-fast-fashion">(Fashionista)</a></p>
